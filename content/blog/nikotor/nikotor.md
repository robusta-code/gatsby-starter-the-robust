The pill to heal your web

---

Simple, Stupid, yet working CQRS in Kotlin for simple applications. Those that doesn't need a kube or Kafka to start.

Create an application where state is kept in Memory, not in a database. In case of
reboot, the state is rebuilt from saved event.

In case of success, you have plenty of options to scale your state in the right kind
of database.

**Adapt later.**
