Masala Parser is a swiss knife for creating you own parser in Javascript

---

Masala Parser is a Javascript implementation of the Haskell Parsec. It is plain Javascript that works in the browser, is tested with more than 450 unit tests, covering 100% of code lines.

Use cases:

- It can create a full parser from scratch
- It can extract data from a big text and replace complex regexp
- It works in any browser
- There is a good typescript type declaration
- It can validate complete structure with variations
- It's a great starting point for parser education. It's way simpler than Lex & Yacc.
- It's designed to be written in other languages (Python, Java, Rust) with the same interface

Masala Parser keywords are simplicity, variations and maintainability. You won't need theoretical bases on languages for extraction or validation use cases.
